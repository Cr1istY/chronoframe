# Location Providers

Location providers convert photo GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) into human-readable city or country names during photo processing. This process is called Reverse Geocoding.

By default, no configuration is required. ChronoFrame uses OpenStreetMap Nominatim as the default location provider.

However, you may need to configure a custom location provider in the following cases:

- Your server is located in mainland China
- The connection between your server and Nominatim is blocked

ChronoFrame supports two location providers. You can choose the appropriate one based on your needs.

## Nominatim

Nominatim is a free reverse geocoding service provided by OpenStreetMap. By default, ChronoFrame uses Nominatim as the location provider.

If your server cannot connect to the official Nominatim service, you can set up your own reverse proxy and use it through the following configuration:

```bash
NUXT_NOMINATIM_BASEURL=http://your-nominatim-proxy-url/
```

## Mapbox Search API

Mapbox Search API provides powerful reverse geocoding capabilities. To use Mapbox as your location provider, you need a [Mapbox access token](https://console.mapbox.com/account/access-tokens/).

```bash
NUXT_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-mapbox-access-token
```

When you configure the `NUXT_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable, ChronoFrame will automatically use Mapbox Search API as the location provider.
